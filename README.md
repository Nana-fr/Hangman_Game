# Project nÂ°2: Hangman Game

This is my second online web application using JavaScript as part of my Web Developer Training Course at AFPA.

* The computer chooses a word randomly in a list and the player tries to guess the word by suggesting a letter. Each letter of the word to guess is represented by an underscore.
* If the player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, it will appear in all its correct positions.
* If not, the player try another letter.
* The player has 7 guesses, if after 7 guesses he still doesn't find the word, he loses the game.
